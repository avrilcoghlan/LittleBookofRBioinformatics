Answers to the exercises on Sequence Databases
==============================================   

Q1. *What information about the DEN-1 Dengue virus sequence (NCBI accession NC\_001477) can you obtain from its annotations in the NCBI Sequence Database?*

To do this, you need to go to the `www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov>`_ website 
and type the DEN-1 Dengue virus genome sequence accession (NC\_001477) in the search box, and press 'Search'. 

On the search results page, you should see '1' beside the word 'Nucleotide', meaning that there was one hit to a sequence record in the NCBI Nucleotide database, which contains DNA and RNA sequences. If you click on the word 'Nucleotide', it will bring you to the sequence record, which should be the NCBI sequence record for the DEN-1 Dengue virus' genome (ie. for accession NC\_001477). 
	
On the webpage for the NCBI sequence record for the DEN-1 Dengue virus' genome (webpage http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_001477) , you will see in the DEFINITION, ORGANISM and REFERENCE fields of its NCBI record: 

DEFINITION: Dengue virus type 1, complete genome.
ORGANISM: Dengue virus 1
REFERENCE: There are several papers (the first is):
AUTHORS: Puri,B., Nelson,W.M., Henchal,E.A., Hoke,C.H., Eckels,K.H., Dubois,D.R., Porter,K.R. and Hayes,C.G.
TITLE: Molecular analysis of dengue virus attenuation after serial passage in primary dog kidney cells
JOURNAL: J. Gen. Virol. 78 (PT 9), 2287-2291 (1997)

There are also some other references, for papers published about the Dengue virus genome sequence. 

Q2. *What were the nucleotide sequences published in Nature volume 460, page 352?*

To do this, you need to go to the NCBI website at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov and type in the search 
box on the top: "Nature"[JOUR] AND 460[VOL] AND 352[PAGE]

Here [JOUR] specifies the journal name, [VOL] the volume of the journal the paper is in, and [PAGE] the page number.

This should bring up a results page with "50890" beside the word "Nucleotide", and "1" beside the word
"Genome", and "25700" beside the word "Protein", indicating that there were 50890 hits to sequence records in the Nucleotide database, 
which contains DNA and RNA sequences, and 1 hit to the Genome database, which contains genome sequences, and 25700
hits to the Protein database, which contains protein sequences.

If you click on the word "Nucleotide", it will bring up a webpage with a list of links to the NCBI sequence 
records for those 50890 hits. The 50890 hits are all contigs from the schistosome worm *Schistosoma mansoni*.

Likewise, if you click on the word "Protein", it will bring up a webpage with a list of links to the NCBI
sequence records for the 25700 hits, and you will see that the hits are all predicted proteins for *Schistosoma
mansoni*.

If you click on the word "Genome", it will bring you to the NCBI record for the *Schistosoma mansoni* genome
sequence, which has NCBI accession NS\_00200. Note that the accession starts with "NS\_", which indicates that
it is a RefSeq accession. 

Therefore, in *Nature* volume 460, page 352, the *Schistosoma mansoni* genome sequence was published, along
with all the DNA sequence contigs that were sequenced for the genome project, and all the predicted proteins
for the gene predictions made in the genome sequence. You can view the original paper on the *Nature* website
at `http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v460/n7253/abs/nature08160.html <http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v460/n7253/abs/nature08160.html>`_.

Q3. *How many nucleotide sequences are there from the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis in the NCBI Sequence Database?*

xxx
To answer this, you need to go to www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, and select "Nucleotide" from the drop-down list  at the top of the webpage, as you want to search for nucleotide (DNA or RNA) sequences.

Then in the search box, type "Aspergillus nidulans"[ORGN] and press 'Search'.

Here [ORGN] specifies the organism you are interested in, that is, the species name in Latin.
The results page should give you a list of the hits to sequence records in the NCBI Nucleotide database. It will say “Found 29270 nucleotide sequences, Nucleotide (12422) EST(16848)”. Beside “Nucleotide”, it should say “12422”, which means that 29,270 sequences were found, of which 12422 are DNA sequences and 16848 are ESTs [as of 17-Jan-2011]. Note that there are new sequences being added to the database continuously, so if you check this again in a couple of months, you will probably find a higher number of sequences (eg. 30,000 sequences).

[Note: if you just go to the www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov database, and search for “Aspergillus nidulans”[ORGN] (without choosing “Nucleotide” from the drop-down list), you will see 12422 hits to the Nucleotide database and 16848 to the EST database.

 Note if you search for “Aspergillus nidulans”, without using [ORGN] to specify the organism, you will get 13562 hits to the Nucleotide database and 17319 to the EST database, but some of these might not be Aspergillus nidulans sequences – they could just be sequences for which the NCBI sequence record contains the phrase “Aspergillus nidulans” somewhere.]
